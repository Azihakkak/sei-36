      <h2>Biography</h2>
        <img class= "img-size bio" src="img/mh_books.png" alt="Margaret Hamilton beside a pile of books"><p class= "bio">Margaret Elaine Heafield was born on August 17th 1936 in Paoli, Indiana, to Ruth Esther & Kenneth Heafield. In 1964, Margaret saw a recruitment ad for software developer by MIT. Margaret jumped to the opportunity & joined the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory (now called Charles Stark Draper Laboratory), which worked on the Apollo space mission. She worked on many manned & unmanned missions of NASA’s Apollo program.</p>
        <img class= "img-size bio" src="img/mh_chair.png" alt="Margaret Hamilton sitting on a chair"><p class="bio">She was credited with popularizing the term "Software Engineering". It was out of desperation that she came up with the term, to say: “Hey, we’re engineering too.” because software was not taken seriously as other engineering disciplines. It was an ongoing joke for a long time until one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone in a meeting that he agreed with her.</p>
        <img class= "img-size bio" src="img/mh_award.png"><p class="bio">In 2016, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the U.S., from President Barack Obama for her work on the onboard flight software for NASA Apollo lunar modules and command modules.</p>
