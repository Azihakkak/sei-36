        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>Wall is the author of the rn Usenet client and the widely used patch program. He has won the International Obfuscated C Code Contest twice and was the recipient of the first Free Software Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 1998.

        Wall developed the Perl interpreter and language while working for System Development Corporation, which later became part of Unisys.He is the co-author of Programming Perl (often referred to as the Camel Book and published by O'Reilly), which is the definitive resource for Perl programmers; and edited the Perl Cookbook. He then became employed full-time by O'Reilly Media to further develop Perl and write books on the subject.
        Wall's training as a linguist is apparent in his books, interviews, and lectures. He often compares Perl to a natural language and explains his decisions in Perl's design with linguistic rationale. He also often uses linguistic terms for Perl language constructs, so instead of traditional terms such as "variable", "function", and "accessor" he sometimes says "noun", "verb", and "topicalizer".
        Wall's Christian faith has influenced some of the terminology of Perl, such as the name itself, a biblical reference to the "pearl of great price" .Similar references are the function name bless, and the organization of Raku (previously known as Perl 6) design documents with categories such as apocalypse and exegesis. Wall has also alluded to his faith when he has spoken at conferences, including August 23, 1999 at the Perl Conference 3.0 in Monterey, CA.
        Wall continues to oversee further development of Perl and serves as the benevolent dictator for life of the Perl project. The official Perl documentation states that:
        1. Larry is always by definition right about how Perl should behave. This means he has final veto power on the core functionality.
        2. Larry is allowed to change his mind about any matter at a later date, regardless of whether he previously invoked Rule 1.
        Got that? Larry is always right, even when he was wrong.
